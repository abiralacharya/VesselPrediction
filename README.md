# VesselPrediction

On over 25000 rows of Vessel data, various unsupervised machine learning algorithms like Kmeans, Spectral Clustering, DBSCAN, Agglomerativeclustering, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), etc. to predict Vessel ID was used. In the end, GMM was applied because of higher Adjusted Rand Index.

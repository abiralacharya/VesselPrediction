# VesselPrediction

Tried various unsupervised machine learning algorithms like Kmeans, Spectral Clustering, DBSCAN, Agglomerativeclustering, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), etc. to predict Vessel ID with given positional data of different vessels. In the end, GMM was applied because of higher Adjusted Rand Index.
